1.) We can use dmesg command in such a way that it can wait for certain message to come.
    It is done by using "-w" option. We can grep for more than one string using "-e" option
    which works in OR logic.
    
    # dmesg -w | grep -i -e pcie -e dhd -e MIR 
    
2.) To clear kernel log we use "-c" option, but if we run "dmesg -c" option then also it prints 
    kernel log once. If we want to avoid printing, then we have to redirect message as below.
    
    # dmesg -c > /dev/null
