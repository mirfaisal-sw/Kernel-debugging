=======================================================
Watching hardware register using "busyox devmem" tool
=======================================================

$sudo apt install busybox devmem
Usage:
devmem ADDRESS [WIDTH [VALUE]]

Read/write from physical address

        ADDRESS Address to act upon
        WIDTH   Width (8/16/...)
        VALUE   Data to be written

Example:-
$sudo busybox devmem 0x481a0140 32
o/p - 0x00060000

Note - If by running above command error comes like "Bus Error",
then probably clock to the particular hardware module is disabled
whose hardware register is being queried.
So, the best thing is we should run an application which keeps that 
hardware module enabled. For this we can use two different consles, one 
by using Putty and another one by using serial console.
