/*==========================================================*
 * Message logging with printk                              *
 *==========================================================*/
  => printk() messages can specify a log level.
  => All printk() messages are printed to the kernel log buffer, 
     which is a ring buffer exported to userspace through /dev/kmsg.
     The usual way to read it is using dmesg.
     Syntax: printk(KERN_INFO "Message: %s\n", arg);
             where KERN_INFO is log level.
             
   => In Linux there are 10 log levels listed below: -
      Name              String            Alias function         Priority            
      ---------------------------------------------------------------------
      KERN_EMERG           “0”             pr_emerg()            Highest
      KERN_ALERT           “1”             pr_alert()
      KERN_CRIT            “2”             pr_crit()
      KERN_ERR             “3”             pr_err()
      KERN_WARNING         “4”             pr_warn()
      KERN_NOTICE          “5”             pr_notice()
      KERN_INFO            “6”             pr_info()
      KERN_DEBUG           “7”             pr_debug() and 
                                           pr_devel() if 
                                           DEBUG is
                                           defined
      KERN_DEFAULT         “”
      KERN_CONT            “c”             pr_cont()             Lowest
      
   => If the message priority is higher (lower log level value) than the
      console_loglevel the message will be printed to the console.
      In other words, Only messages with a value lower than the console_loglevel
      will be printed.
      
      If the log level is omitted, the message is printed with KERN_DEFAULT level.
      We can check the current console_loglevel with:

      $ cat /proc/sys/kernel/printk
        4        4        1        7
      The result shows the current, default, minimum and boot-time-default log levels.
      
      The first value in our output is the "current console_loglevel". This is the information we were looking for: 
      the value, 4 in this case, represents the log level currently used. As said before this means that only messages
      adopting a severity level higher than it, will be displayed on the console. This is defined at compilation via 
      CONFIG_CONSOLE_LOGLEVEL_DEFAULT.

      The second value in the output represents the "default_message_loglevel". This value is automatically used for messages
      without a specific log level: if a message is not associated with a log level, this one will be used for it. This is
      defined at compilation via CONFIG_MESSAGE_LOGLEVEL_DEFAULT.

      The third value in the output reports the "minimum_console_loglevel" status. It indicates the minimum loglevel which can
      be used for console_loglevel. The level here used it’s 1, the highest. Minimum console loglevel is defined via 
      #define CONSOLE_LOGLEVEL_MIN 1 (defined in file include/linux/printk.h)

      Finally, the last value represents the "default_console_loglevel", which is the default loglevel used for 
      console_loglevel at boot time. Default console loglevel is defined via CONFIG_CONSOLE_LOGLEVEL_DEFAULT.
  
   =>  To change the current console_loglevel simply write the desired level to 
       /proc/sys/kernel/printk. For example, to print all messages to the console:

       # echo 8 > /proc/sys/kernel/printk
       
       We can also change the current console log level using dmesg with -n parameter.
       # dmesg -n 5
       
       sets the console_loglevel "to print KERN_WARNING (4) or more severe messages
       to console".
       
    => For debugging purposes there are also two conditionally-compiled macros: pr_debug()
       and pr_devel(), which are compiled-out unless DEBUG (or also CONFIG_DYNAMIC_DEBUG 
       in the case of pr_debug()) is defined.
       
    => Debugging tips: -
       =================
       For debugging, most developers leave the console_loglevel unchanged and simply use 
       KERN_ERR or KERN_CRIT to ensure the message reaches the console.
       
       Example: pr_err("REMOVE ME: my debug statement that I swear to remove when I'm done\n");
